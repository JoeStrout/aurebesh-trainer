## SRS flashcard program for learning Aurebesh (the Star Wars font)


This is a work-in-progress project to create a simple, free trainer for [Aurebesh](https://aurebesh.org/), the font used extensively at the [Galaxy's Edge](https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/star-wars-galaxys-edge/) areas of the Disney parks, and even occurs in the movies!

This program uses a "spaced repetition system" to help you learn most efficiently.  Also, it's designed so that you can download it to your phone and use it offline.  A great way to pass the time while waiting in line!

This project is just in its very early stages of development.  Please stay tuned for updates!
